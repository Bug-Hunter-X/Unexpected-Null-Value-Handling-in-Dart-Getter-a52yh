# Unexpected Null Value Handling in Dart Getter

This code demonstrates a potential issue with null values in Dart getter methods.  The getter `myVariable` uses the null-aware operator (`??`) to return 0 if `_myVariable` is null. While this prevents a `NullPointerException`, it might mask underlying issues where the variable unexpectedly becomes null.

The problem arises when `_myVariable` is explicitly set to `null`.  The getter gracefully returns 0, which might not always be the desired behavior.  A more robust solution might involve either stricter null checks or providing better error handling.

## Solution
The proposed solution addresses this by adding an assertion to check for null values and throwing an exception if the value is null, improving the management of exceptional cases.
